            <hr>   
            <p>We offer this free check to assess whether the advice you received in respect of your pension was incorrect and not in your best interests, before you decide whether you wish to make a claim for any losses that you may have suffered.</p>
            <p>This service is completely free of charge and you are under no obligation to pursue a claim once this free check has been completed. You can also cancel this free check at any time, at no cost, nor are you obliged to subsequently pursue a claim. </p>
            <p>Where necessary (and possible), we will contact the appropriate third party to obtain copies of documentation relating to your pension and the advice you were provided. You may need to provide some documents to allow us to do this (e.g. proof of ID and address). </p>
            <p>You will need to provide us with any documentation which is in your possession that relates to your pension to assist us to carry out this free check, this could include (but not limited to) finance details, statements, provider details and suitability reports. </p>
            <p>Once the free check is complete, we will contact you with the results, usually by telephone, and discuss our findings with you.  You can then decide how  you would like to proceed. If you do not wish to then pursue a claim, we will simply close your file in accordance with our Privacy Policy. </p>
            <p>If you do wish to pursue a claim, you can choose to do this yourself, free of charge, by contacting the appropriate third party. If they reject the claim, you can escalate the matter to The Pensions Ombudsman/Financial Ombudsman Service.  If the third party is no longer in business, you may be able to direct a claim to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. </p>
            <p>If you choose to use our expertise to assist you with your claim, we will send you our full Terms and Conditions for you to read, sign and return, which will detail our Fees for processing your claim. We will only start representing you once we have received our completed Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p>We may also decide that your case may be better placed with one of our partner law firms, depending on the nature and complexity of the case. If  so, we will contact you to discuss this and obtain your consent to pass any information to them. In this case, the partner law firms Terms and Conditions and Fees will apply and they will send those to you directly to read, sign and return to them.</p>
